# Emoji Custom Tags Data
# Version: 1.0

# W3C tagging is incomplete. None of the yellow people emojis
# have a skin tone tag. To find the traditional yellow smileys
# and people we have to search on "person !tone" to exclude
# all non-yellow people. Great for a computer scientist, not so
# great for users.

# Other missing tags include grandparents, grandpa, grandma,
# doctor, nurse, farm, chef, and even programmer and hacker.
# It is highly unlikely a user to search on "technologist" to
# find a software developer or "health worker" to find a
# doctor or nurse emoji. In point of fact many emoji tags
# are only useful to emoji tag classifiers. Which is fine
# as we can use it as a base for orgnaizing the presention
# of emoji but these tags are not suited for searching by
# humans.
