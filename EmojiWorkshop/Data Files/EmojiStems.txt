# Emoji Stemming Data
# Version: 1.0

# Stemming normalizes tags so that the root word is used instead of a plural (or past tense)
# The search terms and tags are changed such searching for "people" becomes a search for
# "person" and an emoji tagged "people" is instead tagged "person". Stemming lets users
# search as they please with a plural or singular form of a word and get expected results.
# Also stemming cuts down on tag clutter as many emoji are tagged by the W3C with both
# singular and plural forms.

# Using the stemming function we can also eliminate stop words (a, the, in, of) by stemming
# them to an empty string. The empty string is discarded which further reduces tag clutter.
# Searching for all the emoji with "and" in the discription usually doesn't make sense.
# But there is a problem with words like "A". "A" is both an article (a pointing word) and
# a noun (Type A blood). Thus "A" is missing from the list until a special exception can be
# made (probably by looking at the context of the stop word which can then be nicely
# abstracted.)
