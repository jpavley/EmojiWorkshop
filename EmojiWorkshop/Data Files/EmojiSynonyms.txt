# Emoji Search Term Synonym Data
# Version: 1.0

# Using will want to use short search terms and expect them to be
# expanded to show the expected results. "Smile" should expand to
# "smiling". But we don't want to permanently change the tags as
# users will also want to search using the whole term and the
# whole term is more discriptive than the short term. The synonym
# function maps one word to another without changing the tags.

# Note: Some times both synonyms exsist as tags. To show the
# complete results the both words have to be search for. The
# main example is "smile:smiling", both words are tags!
