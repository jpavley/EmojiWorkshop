# Emoji Search Term Synonym Data
# Version: 1.0

# Users will want to use short search terms and expect them to be
# expanded to show the expected results. "Smile" should expand to
# "smiling".

# Some times both synonyms exsist as tags. To show the
# complete results the both words have to be search for. The
# main example is "smile:smiling", both words are tags!

# Synonymming is a kind of asymmetrical mapping: tram is a kind of
# train but not all trains are trams. So we want to map train on to
# tram but not map tram on to train. The result should be that tram
# returns only trams but train returns all types of trains, including
# trams.
