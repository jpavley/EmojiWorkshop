# Emoji Workshop

## In a Nutshell

EmojiWorkshop is a demo add that parses emoji-test.txt and displays the results in a UITableView with custom UITableViewCell controls.

## Backstory

Emoji are awesome. But there are too many of them, some with many varients, some that combine together to create new emoji, some that
don't show up on everyone's device, and often they are interpreted differently on different platforms such that the *feeling* you send is
not always the feeling your friends recieve.

There are several good websites with tons of info about emoji! Here is a good starting point: https://unicode.org/emoji/index.html

One of the best places on the internet to data mine emoji is this directory: https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/

One of the best files to grab meaningful and up-to-date data about the emoji from the platform platform providers is https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/5.0/emoji-test.txt

The motivation for this app is to discover and explore all the emoji and meta data and display in all in your pocket ðŸ˜€
